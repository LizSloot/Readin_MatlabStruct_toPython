### This module is for writing functions for calculations with the variables selected (which are NumPy Arrays, so there are already many operations you can do on them)
### For the sake of readability I advise sticking to a naming convention for the functions.
### As an example I included the sum function for arrays:

def perform_sum(array):
    result = array.sum()
    return result
